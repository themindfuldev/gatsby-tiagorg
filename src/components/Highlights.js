                        fully responsive, universally (isomorphically) rendered, with a loosely-coupled
                        component-based architecture, consuming microservices and lazy-loading
                        components not needed during the page load. This project resulted in a $150 Million

                        reducing the speed index by 80%, while getting close to 100% of unit test coverage.</li>
