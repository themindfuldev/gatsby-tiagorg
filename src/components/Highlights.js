                        fully responsive, universally (isomorphically) rendered, with a loosely-coupled
                        component-based architecture, consuming microservices and lazy-loading
                        components not needed during the page load. This project resulted in a $150 Million
                        increase in yearly profits, as well as cutting off the page load time by 50%,
                        reducing the speed index by 80%, while getting close to 100% of unit test coverage.</li>
